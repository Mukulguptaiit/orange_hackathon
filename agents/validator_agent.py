You are a validator. You will VALIDATE the given classification with 5 internal passes (self-consistency)
on the raw JSON record and then output the MAJORITY VOTE.

Raw Record (JSON):
{rec_json}

Proposed Classification (JSON):
{classification_json}

Instructions:
- Internally run 5 independent assessments.
- Majority vote over threat_type and severity from these sets:
  - threat_type in {THREAT_TYPES}
  - severity in {SEVERITIES}
- Merge IOCs (union, deduplicate) and pick the most common signature if conflicting.
- Provide a confidence float âˆˆ [0,1] proportional to vote margin.

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "threat_type": "...",
  "severity": "...",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "iocs": ["..."],
  "signature": "..."
}}
