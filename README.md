## Agents Overview

- **ClassifierAgent**: Trains and evaluates machine learning models to classify network traffic.
- **ValidatorAgent**: Validates the integrity and accuracy of the data being processed.
- **MalwareAgent**: Detects and analyzes malware within network traffic.
- **PhishingAgent**: Identifies phishing attempts based on traffic patterns and content analysis.
- **DDoSAgent**: Detects and mitigates Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
- **DataBreachAgent**: Identifies potential data breaches based on traffic anomalies.

## Pipeline

The `threat_pipeline.py` orchestrates the execution of various agents to analyze network traffic and detect threats.

## Reporting

- **Dashboard**: Visualizes threat data and presents it in a user-friendly format.
- **ReportWriter**: Generates and saves reports based on the analysis performed by the agents.
